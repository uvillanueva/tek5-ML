    "As we have seend during the course, we can reach more than 0.99 of test accuracy in a couple of minutes on a laptop on the MNIST dataset. However, in many machine learning applications, especially in embedded systems, there is a need to optimize the learning time and also the inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for the fastest possible way to reach a 0.97 test accuracy, on a given hardware of your choice. The hardware that you use may be the laptop of one of your group members (you can also compare two laptops). You need to briefly present the hardware used (type of processor, frequency, number of cores, etc).\n",
    "In that respect, tour objective is to work on the acceleration of learning (model training) and / or of the inference time, using any method that seems relevant.\n",
    "Please note that your objective is not to simply reach the target test accuracy.\n",
    "It is required that you explore at leat one method taken from a book or from a scientific article. You can find the book or the article yourself, or use one of the references presented during the course. For instance, part II of the Deep learning book (see pdf for link) contains many interesting discussions, but other sources are accepted as well. Any research is welcome, including research on libraries that are not as famous as pytorch or tensorflow, like jax.\n",
    "Here are some suggestions :\n",
    "- You can start from the architecture that we use in this example : see pdf for link.\n",
    "And then try other methods to accelerate the learning or inference time.\n",
    "- Try to isolate parameters to present and analyze results of code profiling in order to find speed bottlenecks. Pay attention to the fact that profiling GPUs or pytorch code might have specificities."

    "## Training Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of optimizing for the highest possible accuracy (>0.99), the model was deliberately kept small.  \n",
    "This significantly reduced training time while still reaching the required performance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target accuracy of **0.97** was achieved within a few epochs, typically in less than two minutes on CPU.\n",

    "## Inference Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference speed is critical in embedded systems.  \n",
    "By converting the trained model to TorchScript, Python overhead was eliminated, resulting in faster forward passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is particularly relevant for deployment on edge devices.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High accuracy does not necessarily require deep or complex models\n",
    "- Significant speed gains can be achieved through architectural and optimization choices\n",
    "- Profiling and bottleneck analysis are essential when performance matters\n",
    "- Classical techniques remain highly competitive when properly applied\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining shallow architectures, efficient optimization, and inference compilation, it is possible to reach **97% MNIST accuracy very quickly** on modest hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is well-suited for real-world, resource-constrained machine learning applications."
