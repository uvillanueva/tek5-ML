    "The goal of this exercise is to manipulate a data distribution and to get familiar with the law of large numbers in an informal way.\n",

    "1) Propose a 2-dimensional random variable Z = (X, Y), with X and Y being two real, discrete or continuous random variables. These two variables muse represent meaningful quantities of your choice, and they must have units. Compute the expected value of Z, that must be finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Sample a number n (of your choice) of points form the law of Z and plot them in a 2 dimensional figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) For increasing values n, compute the empirical average of the first n samples and verify that it converges to the expected value, by plotting the euclidean distance between the empirical average and the excpected value as a function of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarks :\n",
    "- Please pay attention to the fact that the expected value and the empirical average are different objects.\n",
    "- Note that both the empirical average and the expected value are vectors with 2 entries, as our variable is 2 dimensional."
