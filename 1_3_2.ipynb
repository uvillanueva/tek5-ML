    "A meteorological station has gathered 800 data samples in dimension 6, thanks to 6 sensors. The operators of the station would like to predict the risk of a tempest the next day, but first, they need to reduce the dimensionality of the data, in order to apply a supervised learning algorithm on the reduced data.\n",

    "The data are stored in the project/data/dimensionality_reduction/ folder :\n",
    "- data.npy contains the raw data\n",
    "- labels.npy contains the results for each sample : 1 if there is a tempest, 0 otherwise.\n",

    "Perform dimensionality reductions of the data, to a dimension of 2 and 3 and plot these reductions onto scatter plots in dimension 2 and 3 as well, coloring the projected samples according to the label of the original sample. You must try at least 2 dimensionality reduction methods. Objective : 1 of the methods, in dimension 2 or 3 must seperate the two classes and thus allow to predict the label base on the projected components only.\n",

    "Super important : write your final conclusion on the method that works best at the beginning of the notebook.\n",

    "You may use libraries such as scikit-learn in order to implement your dimensionality reduction methods, that you are free to choose (linear or non linear). One of the methods that we have seen durinf the class works well, with a well chosen output dimension."
