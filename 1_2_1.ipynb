    "We would like to predict the winner of a Basketball game, as a function of the data gathered half-time.\n",

    "The dataset is stored in project/data/classification/:\n",
    "- The train and test inputs representing the features are stored in X_train.npy and X_test.npy respectively.\n",
    "- If the home team wins, the label is 1, -1 otherwise. The train and test labels ares tored in y_train.npy and y_test.npy respectively.\n",
    "Your objective is to obtain a mean accuracy superior to 0.84 on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark : Pay attention to the fact that the test must not be used for training. The test set should be used only once for scoring. If you compute the score several times, with different models on the test set, it means that you use it mode than one, even if you do not call a scikit model.train() method on the test set ! Note that this strict unique usage of the test set is not always common practice in companies, but try to apply it for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose the classification methods, but you must compare at least 2 models. You can do more than 2 but this is not mandatory for this exercise. Discuss this choice of the optimization procedures, solvers, hyperparameters, cross-validation etc. It is sufficient that 1 of your models reaches the objective score. Several methods might work, including some methods that we have not explicitely studied in the class, do no hesitate to try them.\n",
    "Indication : a solution, with the correct hyperparameters, exist in scikit amon the following scikit classes :\n",
