    "## 📊 Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 300 samples representing physical measurements related to a vehicle operating in an environment. The variables include temperature, altitude, pressure, speed, fuel consumption, and engine rotation speed. Each feature is expressed in meaningful physical units (°C, meters, kPa, km/h, L/100 km, RPM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was constructed to ensure realistic statistical relationships between the variables while satisfying the imposed constraints on means, standard deviations, and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Statistical Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each column has a distinct mean and standard deviation, reflecting different physical scales and natural variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environmental variables (temperature, pressure) have relatively small variability.\n",
    "- Mechanical variables (engine RPM, speed) exhibit larger dispersion.\n",
    "- Altitude has the highest variance due to its wide range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diversity ensures that the dataset is suitable for studying normalization and scaling techniques in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset exhibits three types of correlations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive correlations\n",
    "- **Speed vs. Engine RPM**: As vehicle speed increases, engine rotation speed increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Negative correlations\n",
    "- **Altitude vs. Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.\n",
    "- **Speed vs. Fuel Consumption**: Higher speeds lead to reduced fuel consumption in the modeled regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Near-zero correlations\n",
    "- **Temperature vs. Mechanical variables**: Ambient temperature is largely independent of engine behavior and altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset demonstrates how statistical properties can be controlled while preserving physical realism. It provides a solid foundation for introducing concepts such as feature scaling, correlation analysis, and exploratory data analysis in machine learning.\n"
